Follow these steps to effectively identify and fix code issues:

## Step 1: Run Lint and Identify Errors
- Execute the linting command to scan your codebase
- Take note of all errors and warnings without immediately fixing them
- Categorize issues by severity and type

## Step 2: Analyze the Codebase Holistically
- Examine related files to understand their interconnections
- Review the overall architecture and component relationships
- Understand how the affected code fits into the larger system
- Identify patterns in the errors that might indicate structural issues

## Step 3: Implement Thoughtful Fixes
- Address issues systematically rather than just silencing linting errors
- Apply industry best practices when making changes
- Consider refactoring opportunities that improve code quality
- Ensure fixes maintain or enhance the existing functionality
- Test changes thoroughly to prevent regression issues

Remember that the goal is to improve code quality, not just eliminate linting errors.
